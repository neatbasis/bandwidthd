Add struct for storing IPv6 information
Make IP information use a linked list
Add mac record support to cdf
Add support for multiple sensors using the python DBAPI

OLD PROJECT TODO (will still get done)

Move output modules to forked section
Config switches for sample intervals and graphing ranges

# Features requested by people, I make a note of them here in case myself
# or someone else wants to come along and implement them.
Stoilis:
List of IP's to exclude from the page
Switch to hide all ip addresses

Me:
Switch to only graph traffic not to and from the local network (internet
	traffic only)

Change ram datastore:  Linked lists with identifiers that store only non-zero traffic, use
	longs for traffic storage instead of long longs and implement a multiplyer field.
	will allow implementation of custom ports to graph and reduce ram usage by 70%ish
